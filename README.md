## 🤷 Research Question
"Does having frequent health problems impact income?"

## 🔎 Hypothesis
People with more frequent health problems typically have a lower income than those without frequent health problems.

## 📉 Key Findings
When age, sex, and disability status are held constant, each increase of 1 unit in the 'HLTHPRB' variable leads to a corresponding 17.72% decrease in income. 

Compared
to those with no difficulties doing ADLs due to health problems, those that very often have difficulty doing ADLs due to health problems are projected to make approximately 70.87% less.

## 📖 Variables
The data I used was collected from the [General Social Survey in 2022](https://gss.norc.org/). Respondents either completed face-to-face interviews, a web self-administered questionnaire, or a phone interview. 

The final dataset after cleaning had 731 rows and 5 columns.

* 4 = OFTEN
* 5 = VERY OFTEN

### 3. **REALRINC**- respondent's income in constant dollars (USD)
